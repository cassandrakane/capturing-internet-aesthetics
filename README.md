# Capturing Internet Aesthetics: Translating Instagram Hashtags into Color Palettes

This project presents novel means of capturing and visualizing the color palette for any given internet aesthetic. Specifically, this online curation tool allows users to enter any hashtag: #cottagecore, #darkacademia, #egirl, etc; then, the automated curator pulls a series of publicly accessible Instagram posts containing that hashtag, computes the most prominent colors from each post, and constructs a color palette collage based on these computations.
